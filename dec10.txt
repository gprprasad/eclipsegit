GIT STASH :
===========
It means,it will do the 2 things i.e., it will take a backup and it will try to undo the particular 
files that you was modified.this will happen before the commit.
->To create stash
$git stash
->to list all stash
$git stash list
->reapply the changes,remove the stash
$git stash pop
->apply a specific stash from repository
$git stash apply stash@{num}
->remove the stash from repo
$git stash clear

git squash:
===========
It is use to combaining all commits into one commit when merge is required.If you already pushed 
commits to github,and then squash them locally,you will have to force to push to your branch.
$git push origin branch-name --force.
cmd--> git rebase -i HEAD~n (n=howmany commits you want to squash)
====
STEPS:
1.create new branch called squash
2.create files add and commit those files.
3.after commited squash the above two commits then cmd is "git rebase -i HEAD~n(n=2)".if you want to
squash four commits then n=4.
4.after executing the above cmd one window will be open which is having commit messages.
5.In that message we able to see PICK word it can replace with SQUASH word then save the file.
6.Then you push to remote in remote repo you see combained commit.
[NOTE:if you want to do squash operation atleast you want two commits]
7.If you want to remove squash go to squash branch then use this command "$git rebase --abort".
NOTE:you can always edit the last commit before you pushing into repository
cmd-->   $git commit --amend

GIT REVERT [before commit] :
============================
It is used for if you accidentally done some changes in your local repository then you wants undo the
changes then you want revert operations.
It is 3 types: 1.soft 2.mixed 3.hard
1.soft:If you use this cmd it can undo the chenges from local repo after that the HEAD pointer movies
to prvious commit ID.    CMD:$git revert --soft HEAD~1
2.MIXED: By using this we can undo from local repo and staging area.
CMD: $ git revert --mixed HEAD~1
3.by using this we can undo from all three areas i.e., localrepo,staging and working tree.
CMD: $ git revert -- hard HEAD~1

GIT RESET [after commit] :
==========================
You can undo the commits in two ways..firstly you can use git revert,if you want to keep your commit
history and the second is you can use git reset,which you delete all your commit history and bring 
HEAD to commit where you want.
->revert a commit ID
 $ git revert <commit ID>
->If you want to change HEAD one commit id to another,then 
 $git checkout <commit ID>

EXAMPLE :If one branch have 7 commits but i want to change HEAD 3rd commit then,
	$ git checkout <3rd commit id>
after this we see logs it display from 3rd commit id,but i want to see 7 commits then we give branch
name	$ git checkout <branch name>   after this we can see all 7 commits.

GIT PULL :
==========
Git pull means it will download the data from remote repository and it apply to the local repository.
PULL=FETCH+MERGE

GIT MERGING :
================
Git merging menas it is used to merge two branches to committing the data easily.
-> $ git merge sourcebranch destinationbranch
Fast Forward Merge:




tomcat changing port---server.xml
1.<server port>
2.<http port  redirectPort>
3.<ajp port redirectPort>
