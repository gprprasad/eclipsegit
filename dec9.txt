->In .git folder we have hooks,info,objects,refs,config,description,HEAD default folders and files.
BRANCH->A branch in git is a simply pointer to a commit.

BRANCHING STRATEGY->
====================
1.github flow is a best branching strategy.
2.github flow simply states that when working on any feature or bug fix,you should create a branch.

HOW TO PUSH REMOTE REPOSITORY:
=============================
1.you create the branch.
2.you clone or checkout the latest code from repo.
3.edit whatever you want to edit.
4.you should add and commit to local repo.
5.you have to push branch first to remote repo after that you push modifying files to remote repo.
6.then you able to see the changes in remote repo.
-->git branch -a :shows all local and remote branches
-->git branch -r :shows only remote branches
-->git brnach -l :shows only local branches

If you done a commit how it take internally...
============================================
If you commit a mesage then internally it create a blob(binay large object) for every file on top of 
this its create tree object i.e., it have blob oject information and some data on top of this we have
commit message and user information.These total process called as "single commit repository data".

GIT CHERRY-PICK :
===============
Git cherry-pick means it is a  one type of merge but don't merge all data from source to destination,
pick whatever you want by using commit ID.

Diff between merge and cherry-pick:
==================================
MERGE:If you use git merge command it will merge all the data which is not in destination branch.
CHERRY-PICK:If you use cherry-pick we can merge particular data by using its commit id.
